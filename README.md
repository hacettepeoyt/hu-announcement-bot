- There are lots of departments in Hacettepe University. Hacettepe Duyurucusu doesn't include them all, yet. You can
  grap a soup from [BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and scrape the department
  website you want. Don't forget to
  visit [detailed instructions](https://github.com/furkansimsekli/hu-announcement-bot/tree/master/docs/scraper-guide.md).
- There might be open issues right now, maybe you know the solution, and you have the free time. Any help is
  appreciated.
- You have an idea for a new feature, and you want to add it; I'm waiting for your pull request mate!
